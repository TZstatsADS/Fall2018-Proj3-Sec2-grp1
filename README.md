+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for enhancement of the resolution of images. We implemented a baseline Gradient Boosting Model and some of the improvements we offer are using XGBoost and Support Vector Machines.
	
**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) (Alphabetically)

Min Jin: designed feature.R part and superResolution part. Also try to transfer all codes to Python to improve speed.

Yukun Pei (Presenter):

Atishay Sehgal: attempted to design svm and xgboost models and cnn.R. He also tried to tune parameters for them. 

Wenting Yu: designed feature.R and superResolution.R part. She tuned parameters for baseline model (gbm model) and gave the FINAL VERSION of baseline model.  

Lingyi Zhao: designed xgboost model and random forest model as well as tuned parameter for xgboost and gave FINAL VERSION of xgboost model.
