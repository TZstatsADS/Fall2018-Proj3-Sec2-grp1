### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the baseline method for images.

[Contribution Statement]:

Min Jin, Wenting Yu and Lingyi Zhao all designed feature.R part. 

Min Jin and Wenting Yu designed superResolution part. feature.R and superResolution parts are used for baseline. 

Wenting Yu discussed with group members and tune parameters for baseline model (gbm model). Wenting gave the FINAL version of baseline model.  

Atishay Sehgal tried to design svm and xgboost models and cnn.R. He also tried to tune parameters for them. 

Min Jin tried to transfer all codes to Python to improve speed. 

Lingyi Zhao designed xgboost model and random forest model as well as tuned parameter for xgboost. Lingyi gave FINAL version of xgboost model.
